# Dark Mode Coding Challenge 🌙 

&nbsp;
# Tasks 📖
- Add dark-mode switching functionality to the *existing* dark-mode button.
  - Use the *existing* dark-mode scss file.
- When in dark-mode:
  - The dark-mode button icon should be `faSun`.
  - The dark-mode button icon colour should be `(#FFA500)`. You can use the `color` prop on the `Icon` component.
  - The save button colour should be `(#BB86FC)` and button text colour should be black - on hover/ focus it should change opacity to 75% and colour to a 
  gradient left to right from `(#BB86FC)` to `(#8A4D76)`.
  - The submit button colour should be `(#03DAC6)` and button text colour should be black  - on hover/ focus it should change opacity to 75% and colour to a 
  gradient right to left from `(#03DAC6)` to `(#FA7C91)`.
- Save chosen mode (light|dark) in localStorage/ cookie. Load this saved mode in app after page reload in browser.
- Write (a) test(s) for dark-mode switch.
